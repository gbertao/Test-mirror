      "message": "I did consider something similar to b/178038565, but then I found it too much mental burden to figure out the individual needs of each process, especially when I don\u0027t know most of these processes are doing. (You can see that I was granting more fine-grained allows / dontaudits in previous revisions)\nI then changed to just grant \"read_fstab\" to any domains that are calling ReadDefaultFstab() or ReadFstabFromFile(), since it seems like they really need these permissions (else presubmit boot test would fail)\n\nImplementing b/178038565 or not, I still think we should land this change first. We can tighten the rules afterwards if b/178038565 introduces any new API. Right now I\u0027ll be granting ReadDefaultFstab() callers \"read_fstab(domain)\", else the ReadDefaultFstab() call would fail",
