The mixed-build test regression for which I reverted them was unrelated to the contents of these patches and was caused due to the patches uncovering a bug in GSI sepolicy compilation/loading. For further details, please do look at the email thread we have going on about this. I will also split up the topic into smaller chunks to reduce risk further. Thanks in advance!\n\nRegards,\nHridya",
