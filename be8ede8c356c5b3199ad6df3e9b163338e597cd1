      "message": "Hi, Chad,\nThis change is part of virtual fingerprint HAL feature developed (still lives) on internal-master. I was recommended to check this part of change (sepolicy) to AOSP to avoid future merge conflict. \nThe virtual HAL is only built on debug release (i.e. userdebug/eng), and all those added system properties are internal.\nThanks for review,\nJeff",
