The above proposal has been implemented.\n\nRegarding the two test failures reported by Treehugger: to me these look like infrastructure errors and not like issues related to this patch.\n\nI will start a few additional runs for build targets not yet covered by Treehugger and for which previous versions of these patches triggered build errors.",
