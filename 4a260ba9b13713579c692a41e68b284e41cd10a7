It\u0027s a relaxation of neverallow rules.\n\nCan you please update the commit message to read something like:\n\nReason for rule relaxation: Samsung devices continue to ship using a file based OTA mechanism. This mechanism was removed from SELinux policy in commit 7388575591ff2f55afa887851f5d593963b4552f. Devices which support file based OTA are unable to use dm-verity protections, and as a result, are more vulnerable to persistence attacks where filesystem metadata or layout is attacked.",
