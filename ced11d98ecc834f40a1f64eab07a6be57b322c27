      "message": "We used to have \u0027hwbinder_use(hal_audio_default)\u0027 for interacting with other HIDL HALs, applied on per-device basis, since it depends on the actual HAL implementation.\n\nNow, if some HAL implementation needs to interact with AIDL HALs, it obviously needs \u0027binder_use\u0027, but this is likely implementation-specific as well. So I would suggest putting this rule under the appropriate \u0027device/\u0027 project.",
