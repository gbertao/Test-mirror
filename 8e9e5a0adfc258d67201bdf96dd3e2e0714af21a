Please review the list of services so that we can handpick and remove the services that do not make sense for rubidium.\nThis seemed like the best way to have controlled access to sandbox and also, unblock testing and alpha releases.\n\nFor local testing, CTS webkit, and admob testing :\n   We shall have a version of the CL that audit logs all of these service accesses",
