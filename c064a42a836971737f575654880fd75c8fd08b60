The good news is, with Icdc0b074de73ce879500b372a47da51354d3ae68 (and some changes to `frameworks/native` to actually write to the new location), I can already write here after running `adb shell setenforce 0`, which we\u0027ve been doing all along. (Though it\u0027s possible that could start failing, the same way `data/user/` stopped working recently!)\n\nThis is all way out of my knowledge base, so I\u0027m wondering if you have any advice or pointers on where to look. (I can also dig through b/64831661 in case I\u0027m missing something there.)",
