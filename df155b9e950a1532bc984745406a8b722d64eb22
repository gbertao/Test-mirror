Splitting them by label would make sense if we designated access to /dev/random as more privileged to prevent an attacker from depleting the entropy pool and either blocking another consumer or encouraging the consumer to fall back to /dev/urandom.\n\nIn practice, these pools are not meaningfully different, though, and our policy already grants complete access to both, so consolidating lgtm.",
