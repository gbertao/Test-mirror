      "message": "@dvander@google.com: good point! This was seen on an Android R device _without_ metadata encryption enabled (i.e. the userdata mount doesn\u0027t use dm).\n\n\u003e which is required since Android R\n\nWhile the device in question is probably misconfigured, I\u0027m curious how this is enforced -- is it only via tests (VTS)?\n\nVTS compliance aside, given that fs_mgr technically still seems to support this mode (judging by the `!can_use_devicemapper` fallback), I wonder if it\u0027s worth merging this? Perhaps with a clarification in the commit message that it only applies to devices with no FBE or no metadata encryption.\n\nAlternatively, we could just add a note to fs_mgr that the code path is deprecated and isn\u0027t guaranteed to work.",
