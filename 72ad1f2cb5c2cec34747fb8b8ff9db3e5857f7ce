      "message": "Well, I mean, yes, in general any addition will slightly slow down the device.\n\nThe main question is:\nLet A be all of the permissions all classifier HALs need,\nLet B be all of the permissions all prediction HALs need,\nThen are A and B roughly the same (roughly roughly meaning, combining them doesn\u0027t represent a security issue), then we should combine them.\n\n\u003e a device might have one, but not another, I think that we should keep them separate.\n\nThis doesn\u0027t necessarily matter because we are defining the attributes here. Even if we have a specific classifier HAL requiring some permissions and a specific prediction HAL requiring others, these could be running in separate domains without needing a separate HAL attribute.",

      "message": "Thanks Steven for the explanation. I had some more discussions, and the current proposal is to add \u0027InputProcessor\u0027 instead, and then combine the old HAL with the new HAL into InputProcessor.\n\nIn this CL, I\u0027m now adding a new attribute for InputProcessor. In a future CL, once the InputClassifier stuff is removed, I can remove the sepolicy for it, as well. This will avoid slowing down the device while unblocking us in the near term.",

I was also thinking about the possible name in case we do combine them, and couldnt come up with a good common name, which suggests it wouldnt be the right abstraction. So I think it\u0027s best to keep them separate.",
