      "message": "I feel really nervous allowing something like the unprivileged shell user the ability to control linker config variables. The linker is responsible for loading every program, and the idea that one unprivileged user could configure this seems ... unnecessarily dangerous. Even if we needed to keep this as a property, it would be safer to only let \"adb root\" / \"su\" set the property, instead of the unprivileged shell user.",

      "message": "Again, I expect this to be removed once linkerconfig generator seems to work properly from many cases. I agree that setting this property only from \u0027su\u0027 would be much safer, but while this property exists I thought it would be better to let them set this property from shell directly considering the purpose of this property. If you have security concerns for this property, I\u0027m OK to remove this.",
