      "message": "We probably need to update this. It uses to be that audio hal was asking system server directly via binder to change the scheduler.\n\nIn this series of changes: go/ag/#/q/topic:remove-binder-call-from-hal, I\u0027ve made a change to make audio hal to delegate scheduler change via audioserver to system server (because direct calls to binder from hals are being clamped down). However, audio_hal still needs to be able to adjust niceness of its threads by itself.\n\nConsidering that, we probably don\u0027t need this rule:\n\nallow system_server hal_audio_server:process { getsched setsched };\n\nThe second one isn\u0027t needed if having having a permission for \"audioserver:process\" is enough if the audioserver changes the scheduler *on behalf* of hal, as opposed to just hosting hal in the same process.\n\nPlease confirm that \u0027getsched / setsched\u0027 is not needed for setting thread\u0027s nice number.",

      "message": "Yes, this should definitely be removed. However, this has nothing to do with the refactoring performed in this commit. The solution is to land a separate commit that cleans up the scheduling policy Binder IPC rules which are no longer needed. Whether such commit lands before or after this one, does not matter.",
