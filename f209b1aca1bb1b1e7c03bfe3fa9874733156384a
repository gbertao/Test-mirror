      "message": "The original rule was written as:\n\n  r_dir_file(storaged, proc)\n\nwhich allows you to read all files, directories, and symlinks labeled as \"u:object_r:proc:s0\". This consists of a number of files in /proc, as you can see from running:\n\n  adb shell su 0 ls -laZ /proc | grep u:object_r:proc:s0\n\nHowever, that doesn\u0027t give you access to /proc/PID entries, which do not use the \"proc\" label.

The first rule is needed to list out entries in the /proc directory, and the second rule is needed to recurse into the relevant /proc/pid entries.",
