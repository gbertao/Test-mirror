We don\u0027t have many neverallows for it at the moment.\n\nWe clearly want to allow some apps to be able to talk to it, but I\u0027m not sure I have any clear picture of which ones definitely shouldn\u0027t.\n\nI suppose we could apply the neverallow to { coredomain -exemptions }, but perhaps we should do that for other things too? But then that seems quite a lot of scope creep for this CL.",
