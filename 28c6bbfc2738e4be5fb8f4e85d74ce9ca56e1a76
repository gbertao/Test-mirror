      "message": "it sounds like this should be in device specific sepolicy, not in global policy? GPU drivers are #1 source of critical severity kernel vulnerabilities on Android, and the Media Frameworks remains a top source of remotely reachable vulns. Changes like this create two-stage remote-to-kernel attack surface that is risky and undesirable. I recommend adding this to device customization. Please consider fixing your gralloc implementation to not require GPU access.",
