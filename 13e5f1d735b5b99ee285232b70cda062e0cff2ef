      "message": "+1 to what Alan said, however we a bit different reasoning :)\n\nUnfortunately, the apex-info-list.xml is used by a Mainline module, so we need to keep the interface stable. Having said that, I think that we shouldn\u0027t add more clients that rely on that xml being stable. And especially we shouldn\u0027t expose this xml file to the apps. All apex-related information that might be useful for apps should be exposed via PackageManager APs.",
