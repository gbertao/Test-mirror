      "message": "Stanley, is this really needed? The prop was only added to aid for use in development and testing so that userdebug builds could keep debugfs unmounted by default. If we allow it to be set from vendor init, it beats the purpose since userdebug builds would once again have debugfs mounted by default :( This could cause accidental debugfs dependencies to go unnoticed since user builds are generally tested less compared to userdebug builds.",

This wish is confirmed with our internal kernel maintenance team so we are looking for an easy and solid way to resolve this. Thanks for your consideration : )",
