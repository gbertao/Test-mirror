At that time, I proposed that approach to test vendor image features with test image and arbitrary VM reference DT (e.g. test invalid vendor image hashkey). However, it requires to inject arbitrary VM reference DT so can only run on production device.\nSee: b/323768068.\n\n\nBut Jiyong proposed an idea to test whether real vendor image can be loaded. It\u0027s simpler and can be a CTS test. This CL is written based on the Jiyong\u0027s idea, and more complex test scenario would be handled in another issue. (but with less priority).\n\nHope this answers your question.",
