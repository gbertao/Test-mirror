If you don\u0027t use the macro, you\u0027re not associating systems_server with haldomain, which is a problem.",

      "message": "Behind the covers, at the moment, any domain which hosts a HAL impl needs to be marked with haldomain. Any domain which hosts a Light HAL mipl needs to be marked with hal_light. hal_impl_domain macro is meant to hide the impl details.\n\nThis is the current design of SELinux attributes/policy for HALs. If this design is wrong, we need to change it. I\u0027m fine with landing this as is and change in a follow-up.",
