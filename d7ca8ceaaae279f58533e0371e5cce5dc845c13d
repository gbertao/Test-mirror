      "message": "odsign is the binary that will be invoking odrefresh. The basic split of responsibilities is:\n\n- odrefresh is responsible for checking whether the ART artifacts are still fresh, and generating new ones (if needed)\n\n- odsign is responsible for signing the artifacts generated by odrefresh, and adding them to fs-verity. As well as checking on every boot that the artifacts are still in fs-verity.\n\nSo odsign is about the security of the files, odrefresh about the contents. Can point you to a design doc if you want.",
