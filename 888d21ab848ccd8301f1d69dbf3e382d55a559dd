Perhaps something like:\n\n  # persist.netd.stable_secret contains RFC 7217 stable secrets which should never be leaked to other processes.\n  # make sure they never leak.\n\n...\n\n  # We want to ensure that no other process ever tries tampering with persist.netd.stable_secret, the RFC 7217 stable secrets managed by netd. Doing so could compromise user privacy.",
