We also want `isolated_compute_app`s to be able to get this service.\n\nI am seeing in history that wearable_sensing_service has recently moved from system_api_service to app_api_service to allow CTS tests to be able to retrieve context.getSystemService. But I figured, if i had to skip SELinux policy in CTS tests, I can just use `set enforce 0` - but not sure that is fine to check in?",

It\u0027s unrelated to the permissions.\n\nIt effectively means that a whole lot of things automatically get access to this service (https://source.corp.google.com/search?q\u003dsystem_api_service\u0026sq\u003drepo:googleplex-android%2Fplatform%2Fsuperproject%2Fmain%20b:main%20file:sepolicy%20-file:prebuilt). But do you want that? Would it be better to specifically allow the things that need this?\n\n\n\u003e  has recently moved from system_api_service to app_api_service to allow CTS tests\n\nYeah, we do see that, although it always makes me sad having to weaken protection solely for tests.\n\n\u003e if i had to skip SELinux policy in CTS tests, I can just use set enforce 0 -\n\nThat won\u0027t work on a user build, and CTS has to pass on a user build. It\u0027s fine for non-CTS tests, as long as you make sure the test runs as root.",
