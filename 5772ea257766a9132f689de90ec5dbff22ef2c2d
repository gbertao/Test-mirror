We also want `isolated_compute_app`s to be able to get this service.\n\nI am seeing in history that wearable_sensing_service has recently moved from system_api_service to app_api_service to allow CTS tests to be able to retrieve context.getSystemService. But I figured, if i had to skip SELinux policy in CTS tests, I can just use `set enforce 0` - but not sure that is fine to check in?",
