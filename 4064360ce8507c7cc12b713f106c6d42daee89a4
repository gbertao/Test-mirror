      "message": "I made change to this test to verify if isolated_app and isolated_compute_app has a attribute of isolated_app_all. (Thanks Jeff for the advice!) Then, instead of explicitly matching permissions in this file we use neverallow statement defined in isolated_app_all to detect violations.\n\nThe reason why this is passing is because I made some exceptions on neverallow in isolated_compute_app which lets it pass the presubmit for the first iteration. A new patch (aosp/2418499) is uploaded with well written neverallows and I do see presubmit failures :)",
