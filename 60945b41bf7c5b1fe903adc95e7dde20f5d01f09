Do you know if you\u0027ll need the ability to toggle the feature on public (non userdebug or eng) builds also? If you want to run tests during dogfood, then finalize the setting before the actual release, using the flag on only userdebug and eng builds might be sufficient. If you need to A/B test public builds, or have a kill switch to turn the feature off on public builds, then we probably need to leave this as is.",

      "message": "We\u0027ll probably need the flag in Beta releases as well, so I guess userdebug and eng builds are not enough.\n\nHongyi, thanks for catching that! As you\u0027ve mentioned, the value of this flag is eventually propagated to native code in the form of a system property (persist.sys.fuse). But initially, we thought we might need to use this flag directly from native code, however this didn\u0027t work because we needed to use it too early in the boot process and the value should be consistent across the boot time so we decided to snapshot it in Java and use the snapshot in native code for the next reboot. So you\u0027re right, this specific flag doesn\u0027t need to be in a _native namespace. That being said, we might need to introduce more flags (different cache settings? FUSE configurations?) and given that we\u0027re mostly working in the native level, they\u0027ll probably need to be native flags. Is it ok to keep using a _native namespace or should we revert back to non _native?\nFeel free to move this discussion to go/usefuse :)",
