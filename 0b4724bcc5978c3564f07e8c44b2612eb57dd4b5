      "message": "Is \"allowing dumpstate to read this\" basically only \"allowing this to appear in bugreports\"? If so, I don\u0027t see very strong reasons either way.\n\nReading the contents of netd_stable_secret_prop allows the reader to predict all IPv6 addresses generated by the device on any network. If the reader is the user, then that\u0027s not really a problem since the user can find this out by themselves.\n\nThat said, there\u0027s also little value in being able to read this property in bugreports. The only interesting things about it are whether it\u0027s non-empty (it should always be) and whether it\u0027s the same as it was on previous boot (which we can\u0027t check for in bugreports). What\u0027s interesting in bugreports is the IPv6 addresses that are generated from the stable secret, not the secret itself.\n\nFWIW, Linux does not allow unprivileged users to read the secret.",
