      "message": "One of the trickiest things about this change is that it also needs to be applied throughout the Android ecosystem. I will note a couple of resources in the bug, but consider this query:\nhttps://cs.android.com/search?q\u003disolated_app%20f:te$%20-f:system%2Fsepolicy\n\nIn order to get rid of this, I would strongly encourage to avoid renaming \u0027isolated_app\u0027 to \u0027isolated_app_all\u0027. Instead, we can change the type of isolated_app to be an attribute. This will avoid having to make 100s of additional changes or more across our tree and in downstream branches. The type which is isolated_app now would become something like isolated_base_app or isolated_minimal_app. Hopefully only a few places in ActivityManager would need to be fixed up.\n\nThough it is nicer, and if we want the rename, some of the things we can do:\n- add a compliance test which analyzes all members of isolated_app_all and only allows them to have specific differences, so that we can check this. Regardless of the rename, this will be a good things to do. treble_sepolicy_tests.py is a good example of how to do this in the build, and CtsSecurityHostTestCases is also another good starting point.\n- write a sed script which performs this change and check it into the tree, so partners can one-click fix this issue\n\nThank you!",
