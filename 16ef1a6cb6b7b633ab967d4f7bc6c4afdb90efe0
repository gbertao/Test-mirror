      "message": "Is f2fs a required feature for Android devices?\n\nIt seems the action is in places like ag/19584615. I would argue that this is a vendor feature. I see 3 options here:\n\nYou can dump the log in dumpstate, and move hal_dumpstate to dumpstate:\nhttps://source.corp.google.com/android/frameworks/native/cmds/dumpstate/Android.bp?q\u003d%22name:%20%5C%22dumpstate%5C%22%22%20-f:api%20f:bp$\u0026sq\u003dp:android$\n\nOr put it each device like ag/19590356\n\nOr use method in go/pixel-recycle to share it. I\u0027m still working on the details to make it possible. I can do this one for you if you can wait.",
