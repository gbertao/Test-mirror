      "message": "I\u0027d prefer if we continue to allow access to setattr for init, eg:\n\n  allow init { dev_type -kmem_device -port_device -device }:chr_file { read open };\n  allow init { dev_type -kmem_device -port_device }:chr_file setattr;\n  auditallow init { dev_type -kmem_device -port_device -device }:chr_file { read open };\n  \n\nI am reminded of your patch at c101a29ebe69197ea386bc219c50a4031d5626ad, where a harmless setattr was being performed. It would have been much worse if someone had saw a denial for this, created a label, and granted access. Setattr only changes the UID/GID/permissions of the file, and is harmless without an open/read operation.\n\nThoughts?",
