This is really a runtime registration event log tags file, it grows without bounds (to an asymptote) until reboot.\n\nKISS Plan (if acceptable):\n- rename event_log_tags_file to runtime_event_log_tags_file\n- rename macro to read_runtime_log_tags\n- writers (logd and init) will not use a macro to add their write access.\n\n[TL;DR]\n\nOf course, this is a legacy from before where we erroneously thought we could declare anything bundled on /system as having access to the file, and anything not bundled would be denied. Essentially before if you can not read this file, then you have no rights posting events messages to the log. But that is not the case, we are limiting access to trusted bundled system applications only.\n\nSince we can not differentiate applications on /system, and store applications, all as untrusted_app, I will always remain troubled ;-/",
