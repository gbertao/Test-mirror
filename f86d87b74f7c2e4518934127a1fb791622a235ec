      "message": "You may also want to include \"exec_type\" here, otherwise it wouldn\u0027t be permitted to perform an SELinux domain transition when executing tcpdump. Specifically, without exec_type, you could never use tcpdump as an SELinux domain entrypoint due to the following neverallow rule:\n\n  # Ensure that all entrypoint executables are in exec_type or postinstall_file.\n  neverallow * { file_type -exec_type -postinstall_file }:file entrypoint;\n\nThis is what\u0027s done for other executables, such as /system/bin/logcat (line 184).",
