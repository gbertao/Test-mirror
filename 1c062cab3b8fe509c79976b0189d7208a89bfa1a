      "message": "Good question!\n\nThere are more requirements than just userdebug/eng to get a dump. The only way to trigger a dump is through a manual `adb shell service call` as root. This isn\u0027t triggered automatically or included in crash reports, of course. For enforcement mechanisms, see:\n\nhttps://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:frameworks/native/services/surfaceflinger/SurfaceFlinger.cpp;l\u003d6298-6303;drc\u003dd696a4fa7fbc6e94476a0f8e5c65b36c046d5ca8\n\nhttps://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:frameworks/native/services/surfaceflinger/SurfaceFlinger.cpp;l\u003d6316-6326;drc\u003d81c7d30ccbf7766089299543fb62b3ac57ce1c93\n\nIn terms of user data: these are the graphics buffers that have been sent to SurfaceFlinger for display on the screen. The content should be similar to what would appear in a screenshot. I believe the only content that wouldn\u0027t be what would appear in a screenshot would be:\n\n  - offscreen buffers (what I was using this to debug)\n  - regions of buffers outside of a region that\u0027s been cropped for display\n\n`setenforce 0` could be possible, but cumbersome. Since you\u0027d need root in either case, I don\u0027t think we\u0027d gain anything from requiring it.",
