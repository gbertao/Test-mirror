      "message": "What is the purpose of android_host? This could be a bit tedious to implement for retargetable builds which could run as the host or guest OS. What about L3 nesting? The middle one is a host and a guest.\n\nUsing boot properties is okay with me though as that will allow us to update the hypervisor at runtime without needing to bake it into the build.\n\nLinux does have a hypervisor framework for this purpose, just nobody except Xen uses it. Maybe a kernel solution would be better in the long run?",
