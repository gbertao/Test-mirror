      "message": "Suggestion:\n\n- persist_wm_debug_prop seems to be a rather large bucket of properties.\n- the userdebug_or_eng() macro needs to be used carefully. At a later date, someone might try to set another wm property from system_server and find that it just works because they\u0027re testing on a userdebug build. Then they get surprised when it doesn\u0027t work on a user build, perhaps causing breakage.\n\nOne way to significantly reduce the risk would be to map the specific property that you\u0027re wanting system_server to set to its own selinux label. That allows you to carefully control what you\u0027re allowing, and helps avoid creating foot-guns for your teammates.",
