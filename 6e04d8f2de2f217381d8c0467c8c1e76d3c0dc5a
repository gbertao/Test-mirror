      "message": "after having thought about this patch more last night, I wonder if we shouldn\u0027t just remove the userdebug_or_eng block entirely? That decreases the differences between build types (reducing complexity). And who cares if apexd spams the kernel logs - there\u0027s no security consequence to it... I\u0027m not sure restricting this to debuggable builds accomplishes any security goals, but it does increase complexity.\n\nAnyway, I\u0027m fine either way.",
