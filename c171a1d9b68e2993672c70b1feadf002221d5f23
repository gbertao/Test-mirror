      "message": "suspend_prop has 7 system properties in it. I am not sure if all of them need to be set by device implementers. If not, you are encouraged to split the system properties into two groups: suspend_prop and suspend_config_prop. The former will still be system_restricted_prop, while the latter could be system_vendor_config_prop.\n\nPlease let us know what is your intention.",
