      "message": "Why is this needed? If I understand the situation correctly, DRM HAL in the past always ran inside mediadrmserver domain. I don\u0027t see any grants there for mediacodec:fd. Did the DRM HAL by any chance run also in mediacodec? If so, binder_call(hal_drm, mediacodec) is would be more appropriate here and mediacodec\u0027s rules would need to be adjusted accordingly as well, so that the DRM HAL can be used from there even when it runs out of process.",

      "message": "Perhaps. I see that mediadrmserver was granted binder_call(appdomain) which means binder_call(untrusted_app) (because untrusted_app belongs into the appdomain set) which means allow mediadrmserver untrusted_app:fd use; and a couple of more rules. However, it doesn\u0027t automatically necessarily mean that DRM HAL needs to IPC over Binder into untrusted app. Do you know why DRM HAL is attempting to IPC into untrusted_app? I mean, it might be an IPC callback, but you said that only mediadrmserver initiates calls into DRM HAL...",
