      "message": "I ran this against my device both with and without the cherry-picked version of this patch and it passes both ways.  My understanding is that sepolicy-analyze complains about loosened neverallow rules, but additional rules are ok (which is effectively the scenario of running CTS with this patch against a device without it).  Is that not the right way to confirm that this change is backwards-compatible?",
