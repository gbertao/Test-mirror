      "message": "As a general rule, the use of userdebug_or_eng blocks is discouraged because it complicates testing and introduces differences between shipping builds and non-shipping builds.\n\nOn a userdebug build, only logpersist has the ability to create misc_logd_file files. \n\nsesearch --allow -t misc_logd_file -p create -c file out/target/product/marlin/root/sepolicy\n\nAnd on a user build, even that is gone.\n\nWith nobody (not even init) being able to create files of this type, is it really a big deal if init manages to create this directory on a user build? Sure, init can create the directory, but on a user build, nobody can create files within this directory. I don\u0027t really think this buys us anything.\n\nI would prefer to avoid the use of userdebug_or_eng blocks here just because it\u0027s yet another difference between what we test and what we ship, and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s worth it for this particular case.",
