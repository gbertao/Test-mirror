We already have it in API 32.0 (https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/system/sepolicy/+/1929528).\n\nDue to the frozen state of branches, we might not be able to merge this CL here.  But the posting of this by a Google SWE, and assuming we get a +2 from a Google SWE, shows approval for folks to cherry-pick this to their local tree and use it for development when working with API 31.0.",
