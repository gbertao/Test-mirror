And you don\u0027t need to include the denial in the comment anyway.\nI\u0027m not sure what it was needed for before, but I believe you now need it to allow atrace to inherit the fd for stderr.\nAlso: This rule should be in atrace.te not traced_probes.te, probably next to the one you\u0027re just adding.",
