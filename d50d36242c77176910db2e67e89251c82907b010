      "message": "I just realize that we should allow this to be configurable. And hence this patch is a follow-up on the previous work. Basically if we don\u0027t get this in, we lose this feature for all Pixel devices, and OEMs will have to jump in to SurfaceFlinger and modify SurfaceFlinger in order to use this hidden feature.\n\nthere will be another follow-up patch that uses this sysprop in SurfaceFlinger\n\nVTS for sysprop? I think I have asked this question in an email thread about how to make some compliance on sysprops but I didn\u0027t recall any conclusion. So no, there are no VTS tests. We don\u0027t enforce anything on this property.",
