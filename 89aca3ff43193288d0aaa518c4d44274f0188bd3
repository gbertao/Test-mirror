If it doesn\u0027t talk directly to OTA engine, then how?\n- adding update_engine OWNER as FYI. Yifan, WDYT of this?\n- It\u0027s really unfortunate that settings app is marked as system_app, and it\u0027s not in its own domain. I\u0027m sure security people have thought about splitting this up before, but I\u0027m not sure how hard it would be.\n- noting, some devices set this permission in device-specific sepolicy",

      "message": "Jeff - I\u0027m curious if you know history of effort to split settings app from system_app. I see that Google settings app is gmscore_app (which shares this codebase). That may be why it\u0027s not split out before, but policy allowing gmscore_app to talk to update_engine seems just as general as this (system_app talking to update_engine).\n\nWDYT about splitting settings app from gmscore_app and system_app and having a specific domain for it or similar?a",
