      "message": "Vendor-specific apps in product might need access to vendor-specific HAL interfaces. For example, dataservice_app type is declared in public product policy \nhttps://android.googlesource.com/device/google/crosshatch-sepolicy/+/master/public/dataservice_app.te\nbut dataservice_app\u0027s access to vendor HALs is in vendor sepolicy\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/device/google/crosshatch-sepolicy/+/master/vendor/qcom/common/dataservice_app.te#11\n\nAbstractly, we have /vendor (and /odm) sepolicy depending on /system (and /product) sepolicy so that we can write permissions that reference entities on both sides.\n\nIn this particular case, vendor_seapp_contexts is being checked against neverallow rules found in /product. It is not strictly necessary, but is still a good thing to check.",
