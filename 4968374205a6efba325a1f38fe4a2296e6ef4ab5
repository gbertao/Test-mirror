      "message": "Added back `hal_drm_clearkey.te` to create domain for clearkey aidl hal. Was hoping to reuse `hal_drm_clearkey` from device policies, but `hal_drm_clearkey` is not defined for generic aosp devices. I tried defining `hal_drm_clearkey` in this change but it would conflict with the various devices that DO define `hal_drm_clearkey`. So I ended up creating a new domain specifically for clearkey aidl hal.",
