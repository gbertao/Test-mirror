For some apps I see denials like:\n\n07-10 00:27:16.382 22948 22948 W dex2oat : type\u003d1400 audit(0.0:276):\navc: denied { search } for name\u003d\"com.example.secondaryrepro\" dev\u003d\"dm-6\"\nino\u003d9017 scontext\u003du:r:dex2oat:s0\ntcontext\u003du:object_r:app_data_file:s0:c252,c256,c512,c76\n\ndex2oat uses fd\u0027s to read the data so I am not sure why this appears. Could it be attributed to some installd FD leak?\n\ninitially I thought that maybe dex2oat also needs read/search on the backed dir in order to properly read from there. But this doesn\u0027t appear to be the case. The strange thing is that even after I added this, I still get the denial. Thoughts?\n\nGiven that this seems to be a separate issue to the bug that this CL tries to address, I\u0027ll split it from this one.",
