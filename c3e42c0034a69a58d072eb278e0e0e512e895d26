From https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html:\n\"By default, the new file descriptor is set to remain open across an execve(2)\"\n\nSo what happens is:\n- Crash_dump is run when a crashing process execs /system/bin/crash_dump\n- The default behavior on Linux is that FDs are passed across exec. So any FDs held by the crashing process are automatically passed to crash_dump.\n- If crash_dump doesn\u0027t have access to the FD (which is the normal case) then an selinux denial occurs.\n- If an selinux denial occurs during testing, then there is a test failure, and folks have their time wasted on flaky presubmit.\n\nWe don\u0027t know what FDs a process holds, so we want crash_dumps\u0027s dontaudits to be broad because otherwise we get test flakes for things that crash_dump should not be doing. In the rare case (like this) where crash_dump actually should have access to a file, the solution is for the change adding that behavior to be properly tested.",
