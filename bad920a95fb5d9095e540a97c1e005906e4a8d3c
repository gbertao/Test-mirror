Can this be scoped down to only the processes which need access? This ensures that we\u0027re not unnecessarily exposing an unofficial \"API\" to processes which don\u0027t have a need for access.",

      "message": "The property is used to configure an internal property of the bufferqueue, so anything that needs to use bufferqueue needs to be able to access this property. The library is used by the framework in many places, and it is also available to vendors. As far as I can tell, there aren\u0027t really any restrictions on where the bufferqueue library can run (even if not all processes are actually going to use it).\n\nAt the very least, I saw usage by the following contexts: system_server, surfaceflinger, bootanim, mediacodec, zygote, drmserver, mediaextractor, mediasxerver, cameraserver, mediaswcodec, system_app, platform_app, priv_app, untrusted_app. I doubt this is an exhaustive list, though.",
