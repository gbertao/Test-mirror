      "message": "One thing I can think of is the \"immersive\" audio where the HAL and associated DSP has to process the audio stream as both the device and the listener change their relative positions. Another thing is camcorder scenarios for switching to the best combination of microphones for beamforming. Since we are already seeing this in some HALs, it\u0027s likely that other HALs will pick this up.",
