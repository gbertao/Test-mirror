      "message": "A couple of additional things:\n1. please add a neverallow rule that prevents most things from accessing this dir (e.g. unprivileged apps).\n2. How can this value be wiped? Does the user have to perform a factory reset in order to reset this data? Is that intentional?\n3. Do we really think believe a generic data dir is the right solution here? What prevents non-checkin data from being written here? What happens when other parts of gmscore want to persist data across factory reset?",
