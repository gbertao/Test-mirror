HIDL has the same rule on L356\n\nAlso, I\u0027m wondering, how were the registration callbacks working before? Were they working at all!? I\u0027m very confused.. It could be that they were actually unneeded in practice. Wow... okay, actually, it seems much safer to keep this, since some of this paths should be hard to hit.\n\nJeff/Nick?",
