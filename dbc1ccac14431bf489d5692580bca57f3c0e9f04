      "message": "I\u0027m quite possibly wrong, but I think I need to add this if something is to be treated as a service in the system server, even if it doesn\u0027t provide any actual Binder API, etc. - e.g. something that tracks the system server lifecycle for services, can be dumped, etc.\n\nThe forcing function is that I want to make the service able to interact with \"adb shell cmd\", which AFAIK means it has to be a service in the system server sense.\n\nDo that sound ok?",
