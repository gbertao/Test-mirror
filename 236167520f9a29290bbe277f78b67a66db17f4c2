      "message": "CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE is a pretty big hammer to use here. It\u0027s in a neverallow rule because it\u0027s a dangerous that we don\u0027t want to grant. Are you certain that (1) the unix permission cannot be made correct? (2) that it\u0027s actually failing due to incorrect unix permissions?\n\nThe reason I ask is because I believe that SetCgroup::ExecuteForTask is racy, and you\u0027ll get a permission denied error if the thread has disappeared. Please verify (and provide evidence here) that it\u0027s actually a unix permissions error that is causing the issue.",
