As-is we need to add a special hook that the art module calls (https://r.android.com/c/platform/system/libartpalette/+/1518042/4/palette_android.cc) and this might be a path for abuse (that library is loaded into every app as part of ART runtime).\n\nThanks\nOrion",

It\u0027s labeling a directory during boot. You want to create files with one label and then share them with another.  \n\n\u003e As-is we need to add a special hook that the art module calls (https://r.android.com/c/platform/system/libartpalette/+/1518042/4/palette_android.cc) and this might be a path for abuse (that library is loaded into every app as part of ART runtime).\n\nI\u0027m not quite sure what you mean here. Apps will not have the necessary permissions to modify these files. Is that what you mean?",
