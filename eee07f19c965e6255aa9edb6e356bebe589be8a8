I would modify this as:\n\n  # Nobody should be doing writes to /system \u0026 vendor\n  # These partitions are intended to be read-only and should never be\n  # modified. Doing so violates important Android security guarantees\n  # and invalidates dm-verity signatures.\n  # Samsung devices violate these security guarantees for now, so we\n  # continue to have to allow this for recovery, but this will go away\n  # in the future.",
