      "message": "What\u0027s confusing about this change is that you\u0027re using \"sandbox\" very differently from how it\u0027s typically used on Android. On Android a \"sandbox\" pretty much exclusively refers to a something used to isolate/contain a process or set of processes, whereas here you\u0027re referring to some kind of scratchpad for writing data. This is leading to confusion. I recommend you use a different word. Feel free to use \"scratchpad\" or anything else, but I would prefer to have sandbox unambiguously refer to the isolation meaning.",
