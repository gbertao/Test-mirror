See https://groups.google.com/a/google.com/g/android-chatty-eng/c/ARq91b2pI8E/m/IJehmV8jBgAJ\n\nThe APIs themselves are @SystemApi and are still guarded by the signature protection MANAGE_APP_HIBERNATION permission, so it should still be secure. Let me know if there are concerns. I\u0027m open to exploring other options.",
