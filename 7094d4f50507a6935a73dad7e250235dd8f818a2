      "message": "I didn\u0027t realize the previous mounting policy was checked in. It might be worth discussing why we believe otapreopt_chroot is the right entity to be mounting and unmounting these filesystems. At first glance, apexd feels like a more natural place. And it avoids spreading APEX code throughout different processes, reducing complexity. However, that discussion shouldn\u0027t block this change from going in.\n\nCan you move these lines to system/sepolicy/PUBLIC/otapreopt_chroot.te , specifically to near or on line 12?\n\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/sepolicy/+/b6388fe75361acae92bc8c21b86e0ad345ea4949/public/otapreopt_chroot.te#12\n\nHaving the labeledfs:filesystem \"mount\" permission be in one file, and the \"unmount\" permission be in another file, is confusing.\n\nYou could modify line 12 to read:\n\n  allow otapreopt_chroot labeledfs:filesystem { mount unmount };\n\nThis can be done in a future change if you want to land these changes now.",
