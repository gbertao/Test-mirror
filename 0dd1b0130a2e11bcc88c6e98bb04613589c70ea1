      "message": "I cannot think of other services that recovery starts/stops. Code search for SetProperty or \"ctl.\" seems to agree.\n\nNot sure if it has been tested under recovery, as the commit message only says \"adbd works\". If not, I think it would be sufficient to ensure sideloading keeps working (by choosing \"Apply update from ADB\" from recovery menu). It will start / stop adbd during that request (https://cs.corp.google.com/android/bootable/recovery/adb_install.cpp?q\u003dadb_install.cpp\u0026sq\u003dpackage:android\u0026dr\u0026l\u003d61). Also note that sideloading on aosp_bullhead or aosp_angler is broken due to other issue. Other targets are expected to work.",
