      "message": "Thank you for comments, Steven.  I actually expected you may dislike this change. :)\n\nEVS is in a bit tricky situation.  IEvsEnumerator interface has been used for EvsManager, which is a system file and uses system services, and EVS HAL implementations from the vendors. Both components are under the same hal_evs domain and, because we update it to support both AIDL and HIDL implementations, it violates this neverallow rule.  So, I created a new domain and make it exempted instead of hal_evs.\n\nCould you please advise me how I can solve this better?  I\u0027d appreciate any help you\u0027d provide.  Thanks!",
