I don\u0027t know the how work is partitioned between init and vendor_init, nor do I know if vendor_init is a subset of init or disjoint from it.  It just occurred to me to wonder, since these values are meant to be customized for devices (vs being set by generic Android), if vendor_init might be the way to go.",
