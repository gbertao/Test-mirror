      "message": "The creation of /data/misc/logd directory (for logpersist), and /data/misc/logd/event-log-tags file (for logd) and for userdebug and eng only is totally managed by init. Ever since we split logpersist from logd domains, logd has had _zero_ access to any content in /data/misc/logd. For these changes, I am only granting logd the ability to read and write to this file, leaving creation to an userdebug or eng-only rc file.\n\nNo one else needs access to this file, I use it for long-term persistence (as in through reboot) so that logcat -b all -L (last logcat) in bugreports work 100% correctly (99.9% correctly without it). logd is responsible for propagating /data/misc/logd/event-log-tags to /dev/event-log-tags on startup, and for keeping it up to date.\n\ninit, logpersist, logd and bugreports are incestuous for this directory, I wanted to keep the overlap minimal and controlled with regards to this directory, but it is a balancing act.",
