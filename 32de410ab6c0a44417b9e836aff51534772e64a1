I hope that\u0027s okay.\n\nAlso, this won\u0027t necessarily cause vts_treble_vintf_vendor_test failure. This will simply instruct the framework to ignore its XML config for HILD HALs, this has nothing to do with VINTF XML fragments. But I agree, the main point of this is to simplify development and testing.",
