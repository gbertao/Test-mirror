      "message": "The use of the word \"property\" here is really confusing. These files are not \"property\" files in the way that /data/property files are property files. Rather, this is just a plain file which happens to contain a string written to by the bootstat process. If this was a true property file it would be labeled as \"property_data_file\" and subject to all of the restrictions of these types of files:\n\n* Can only be read/written to by init\n\nIf this is intended to be a \"property\", then you need to make it so that only init can write to it. Otherwise, a better label would be \"metadata_bootstats_file\".",
