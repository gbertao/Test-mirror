      "message": "Well, dumpstate already has search access (everything does), and read access to the files (most things don\u0027t).\nBut I\u0027m inclined to agree - we don\u0027t allow read access to these directories, only search, except for a small number of exceptions, and system_data_file is very broad.\nAlso, it seems like a good general principle to limit access to these new files to only the things that actually need it. A new label for the directory seems like a good answer to both.",
