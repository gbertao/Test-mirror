      "message": "The *.ignore.cil file is for new labels which have no analog in older policy, which isn\u0027t the case here. In older releases, these files would have been labeled \"sysfs\". As a result, you need to modify system/sepolicy/private/compat/26.0.cil and add \"sysfs_loop\" to the \"typeattributeset sysfs_26_0\" entry. That way, for older Treble images, the policy will work with either \"sysfs\" or \"sysfs_loop\".\n\n(same comment for 27.0 and 28.0)",
