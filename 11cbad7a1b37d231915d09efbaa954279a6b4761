      "message": "I think so.  passwd and group are typically world readable on other Linux systems. \n\nThere isn\u0027t anything significant given to these processes besides this mapping.  For example, it will allow a process that knows that it\u0027s interacting with uid \u00277501\u0027 to be able to map that to \"system_ext_some_daemon\" instead of just reporting the numerical value.  Alternatively it would allow the reverse look up of \"system_ext_some_daemon\" to a uid.\n\nAlso, all processes already have access to the major \u0027platform\u0027 AIDs since they\u0027re built into libc and access to the vendor/odm ones since those files already have the needed permissions.  This just fills in the rest of the gaps.",
