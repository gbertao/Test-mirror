I think this is a great change!\n\nWell bringing up new HALs / hwservices / stuff in Microdroid is always going to require some thought. I don\u0027t think the normal case would be that a change in the host always implies a change in Microdroid. (And probably not the other way round either.)\n\n\u003e \n\u003e I wonder, does it give us more visibility towards a way to avoid needing two versions of sepolicy or to use macros to combine them locally (rather than having a nonlocal copy)? Perhaps not, but I hope we can keep this in mind still!\n\nWell I\u0027m introducing a bunch of divergences (especially removing mlstrusted*), but also reduced the policy here, which hopefully is a step in the right direction. There\u0027s definitely some files we can unify - e.g. te_macros, which I\u0027ve deliberately not pruned.",
