      "message": "AFAIK, when execv(\"/init\") is called, the kernel(Linux in this case) reads the program header of /init to find the program interpreter, which is written as \u0027/system/bin/linker\u0027 for the executables built for Android. Then it executes the dynamic linker inside the process to actually load /init and its dependencies. After the dynamic linker finishes the loading and linking, the linker jumps to the main() of /init.\n\nI think the transition to \u0027init\u0027 domain happens when the process starts to execute an instruction from /init, which is after the dynamic linker.",
