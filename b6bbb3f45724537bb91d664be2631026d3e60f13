This CL just prevents system_server from being killed, but we could just as well erroneously kill another app that just happened to spawn a thread.\n\nWe should really make sure that kills from the system_server are safe (take the intended UID into account).\n\nCan you point out which part of the system_server is doing this kill?",

Yes, this CL doesn\u0027t cover other process being mistakenly killed by system_server, thats out of this CL\u0027s scope and I agree with your idea(take the intended UID into account, and it seems a lot of work/code)\n\n3.
