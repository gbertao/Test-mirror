      "message": "Yes I am (he says sheepishly) as this is (or should be) the only means for anyone to discover the reason the device rebooted. We have had a couple of instances where a partner asked for access (adding device specific rules) and I believe that it should be part of the API to keep resistance low.\n\nPartners have fought to access ro.boot.bootreason (which I shut down to be replaced with sys.boot.reason), so making sys.boot.reason an open r/o API makes some limited sense.\n\nI can respin this to continue making this a on-request-basis if you feel this is too open.",
